Git Workflow

After Cloning the Repository

The command line arguments are added and will work from the command line 
Note: All of these commands are integrated in eclipse git plugin or another git gui.

1. Create your own branch 
        git branch <branch>

2. Change to your branch
        git checkout <branch>
        
3. Edit files, add changes and commit (you can do this as often as you feel necessary)
        git add <filename> or git add . (This is called staging in the eclipse git plugin)
        git commit -m "Message Here"
        
        You may also want to push your branch to the repository as well
        (optional) git push -u origin <branch>
        
4. Switch to active branch "active" branch
        git checkout active
        
5. Pull or fetch and merge from remote repository
        git pull origin active
        
6. Merge your changes into local "active" branch
        git merge <branch>
        
7. Fix any merge conflicts that may arise so your local active branch is a working implementation
        git mergetool

8.  Push the working active branch to the 
        git push origin active
